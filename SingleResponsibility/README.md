[Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) emphasizes on designing a class which has one responsibility (or in other words caters to implementing a functionality). This doesn't mean that the class has only ONE method. A responsibility can be implemented by means of different methods in the class.
